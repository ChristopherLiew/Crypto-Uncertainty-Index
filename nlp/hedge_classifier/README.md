## Linguistic Uncertainty Classifier (Hedge Classifier)
Here we seek to train and validate our hedge classifier using ML / DL / Transformer based models as a novel approach to constructing a cryptocurrency uncertainty index.

## Overview
1. ```Data```
   * Data for training and validating our models. Comprises 1. ```Szeged Uncertainty Corpus``` which contains the raw wiki weasel and other corpuses for uncertainty modelling 2. Cleaned up ```Wiki Weasel```corpus for modelling with sklearn and Hugging Face.
2. ```Models```
   * Model ```training scripts```, ```model weights & binariess``` and various ```Utils```
